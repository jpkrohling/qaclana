= Qaclana Web Application Firewall

Qaclana is an adaptive cloud native Web Application Firewall. It can be deployed on Kubernetes
and OpenShift and can easily scale horizontally.

== Components

Qaclana is split into different components, such as:

* Backend -- the interface where admins interact with and is used to manage the cluster
* Firewall Server -- the "head" of the firewall instances, where the firewall state is stored and distributed
* Firewall Instance, or Proxy -- the actual workers, sitting in front of the target application

Each one of those can scale and survive independently from the others: for a highly distributed but low traffic
service, there might be several firewall instances sitting in front of each target deployment/pod, but one single
firewall service might suffice.

Usually, the backend will be a single instance, but scaling this component is also possible.

Some of the data is stored only in-memory, whereas others are stored into a persistent storage. The database of
choice is link:https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach[CockroachDB], which provides a cloud native SQL database
compatible with PostgreSQL drivers.


== Getting started

To try it out, we recommend using the link:https://gitlab.com/qaclana/qaclana-deployment/[qaclana/qaclana-deployment]
repository.

== Developing

To start developing, you'll need link:https://github.com/google/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation[protobuf].

This project follows the Go conventions and tools, so, it can be build like this:

[source,bash]
----
go get . ./...
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
protoc -I . pkg/proto/*.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:.
go build -o _output/qaclana
----

Once it's built, it can be invoked as:

[source,bash]
----
./_output/qaclana
----

Alternatively, you can use the Go runner, which will compile and run the application:
[source,bash]
----
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
protoc -I . pkg/proto/*.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:.
go run main.go
----

See the `help` output for all available commands.

=== Testing

To run the tests, a `cockroach` binary has to be available on the path. It can be accomplished by:

```bash
wget https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v1.0.4.linux-amd64.tgz
tar xzf cockroach-v1.0.4.linux-amd64.tgz
sudo mv cockroach-v1.0.4.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin
```

=== Backend requirements

The backend requires a CockroachDB instance, which can be set like this:
[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 26257:26257 -p 8080:8080 cockroachdb/cockroach:v1.0.4 start --insecure
docker run --rm -e COCKROACHDB_HOST=${YOUR_IP} -e WAIT_TIMEOUT=1 qaclana/qaclana-create-schema
----

To enter the SQL console, run:

[source,bash]
---
docker run --rm -it cockroachdb/cockroach:v1.0.4 sql --insecure --host ${YOUR_IP}
---

Where `YOUR_IP` is your IP, visible from inside Docker containers (like, `192.168.1.x`).
